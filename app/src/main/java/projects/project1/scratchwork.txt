in general my steps are

- [ ] come up with the project myself
- [ ] make improvements based on the books work


I need to make my
- [ ] prep code
- [ ] test code
- [ ] actual code
for each class

I need a startup class
I need a game class
I need a gamehelper class

********
**UMLs**

Startup
----------
name
location
-----------
checkIfGuessIsCorrect
setLocation
********************
Game
----------

-----------
startGame
setUpGame
checkUserInput
endGame
********************
GameHelper
----------

-----------
getUserInput()
giveUserLocation()
********************


Start the game and ask the user to sink this single start up
located somewhere in the array.
check the user guess and see if hits the location in the array
if it's correct take out the location (in this case I'm going to use an array list)

for example

0 1 2 3 4 5 6

     * * *

array for example is in position 2 3 4

user will give his guess

guess will be verified

0 1 2 3 4 5 6

    *   *
so this will happen until all the locations have been hit
