in general my steps are

- [ ] come up with the project myself
- [ ] make improvements based on the books work
- [ ] edit read me

I need to make my
- [ ] prep code
- [ ] test code
- [ ] actual code
for each class

I'm also gonna be doing some free writing here
just to keep the ideas flowing

I need a startup class
I need a game class
I need a gamehelper class (for the next project I think I'll be needing the book's help)

Startup
----------
name
location
-----------
checkIfGuessIsCorrect
setLocation
********************
Game
----------

-----------
instantiate the gamehelper
instantiate the startup
create random location
instantiate still alive
********************
GameHelper
----------

-----------
getUserInput()
********************

I don't know who does the setting




Start the game and ask the user to sink this single start up
located somewhere in the array.
check the user for an array
if it's correct take out the

for example

0 1 2 3 4 5 6

     * * *

array for example is in position 2 3 4

user will give his guess

guess will be verified

0 1 2 3 4 5 6

    *   *
so this will happen until all the locations have been hit

so what do I know, think about objects
there are startup objects
the game object will instantiate the start up object
the game object will instantiate the gamehelper
give it a location
who will give it a location

man this is harder than i thought. this simple without notes has a lot of things involved with it.

Game helper
knows nothing and just asks the user for input

Game
knows nothing and instantiates the

so who is giving
