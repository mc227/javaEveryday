# One Array Sink a start up
This is the sink a start up on the terminal similar to Head First Java 3e. I'm doing it without notes to give myself the confidence to do progressively difficult projects.
But I'm also gonna draw from what I've read from memory

in general my steps are 

- [ ] come up with the project myself
- [ ] make improvements based on the books work

I need to make my 
- [ ] prep code
- [ ] test code
- [ ] actual code

I'm also gonna be doing some free writing here
just to keep the ideas flowing

I need a startup class
I need a game class
I need a gamehelper class (for the next project I think I'll be needing the book's help)
